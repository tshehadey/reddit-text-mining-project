Following publication, significant methodological concerns [were raised](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08216-x) that [undermined](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-98362-9) the conclusion that an airburst event destroyed the Middle Bronze Age city of Tall el-Hammam. Two post-publication corrections were issued to address the inappropriate manipulation of several dozen figures in the article before ultimately being retracted by the Editors of the journal. According to the retraction notice, all the authors that responded the journal's correspondence opposed the retraction.
